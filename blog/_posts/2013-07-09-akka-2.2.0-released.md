Dear hAkkers,

we—the Akka committers—proudly announce the FINAL RELEASE of *Akka 2.2.0
“Coltrane”*. Half a year has passed since the release of Akka 2.1.0 “Mingus” and
much has happened in our code base. User-visible API changes have been kept to
a minimum, though, as most work happened under the hood; more on that later.
First let us take a look at what Coltrane brings you:

* [Cluster support](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/common/cluster.html)
  (with a big thank-you for the feedback throughout the development cycle); we
  have continued to improve on the preview offered with Mingus, e.g. adding
  [node roles](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/cluster-usage.html#Node_Roles)
  or [distributed pub-sub](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/cluster-usage.html#Distributed_Publish_Subscribe_Pattern)
  or the [cluster client](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/cluster-usage.html#Cluster_Client).
* Fully [actor-based remoting](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/java/remoting.html) implementation with support for multiple
  transports and high-level [failure detection](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/remoting.html#Failure_Detector).
* An [extremely scalable](http://spray.io/blog/2013-05-24-benchmarking-spray/) actor-based [network IO layer](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/java/io.html) 
  with [SSL support](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/java/io-tcp.html#Usage_Example__TcpPipelineHandler_and_SSL) and a
  [protocol pipeline infrastructure](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/io-codec.html).
* Reliable [supervision](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/java/remoting.html#Creating_Actors_Remotely) and 
  [deathwatch](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/remoting.html#Watching_Remote_Actors) for remote actors.
* An experimental preview of [Typed Channels](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/typed-channels.html).

This is just a very high-level overview of the biggest pieces, there have also
been improvements in other areas like test coverage of our [OSGi bundles](https://github.com/akka/akka/tree/v2.2.0/akka-samples/akka-sample-osgi-dining-hakkers), or [how
actor failures are logged](http://doc.akka.io/japi/akka/2.2.0/akka/actor/SupervisorStrategy.html#logFailure(akka.actor.ActorContext,%20akka.actor.ActorRef,%20java.lang.Throwable,%20akka.actor.SupervisorStrategy.Directive)),
or in the semantics of [ActorContext.unwatch()](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/actors.html#Lifecycle_Monitoring_aka_DeathWatch), or a
more performant rewrite of [Agents](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/agents.html), or how [dispatchers](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/dispatchers.html) and 
[mailboxes](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/mailboxes.html) can be configured outside of your code.

### What changes for existing code?

We have continued on our path to unify the semantics between local and remote
actor references. The most obvious difference was that remote references were
bound to a name whereas local ones were bound to a specific actor lifecycle. If
the local actor stops, the reference stops working, which was not the case for
the remote reference in case a new actor was created at the same path. We
changed it such that the local rules apply to remote references as well, making
the “self” references of actors created subsequently with the same name
distinct from each other. As a consequence, ActorRef equality was changed by
taking into account the actor’s UID (which you can see in ActorRef.toString
now).

The other most visible change concerns the creation of Props. Using anonymous
inner classes as factories for your actors means that the required “$outer
reference”—the reference to the enclosing scope—will have an influence on the
serializability of your Props as well as on the thread-safety. Therefore we
have rebased the inner workings of Props on the desired actor’s Class and
its constructor arguments. The benefit is that no closures are formed which
would invite you e.g. to call methods on the enclosing actor, and also that
serialization bindings are used to serialize the constructor arguments.
Previously all Props were serialized only with Java serialization. In order to
make full use of the potential of this approach we have deprecated some of the
existing ways to obtain Props and introduced new ones.

Besides these changes there have been several smaller modifications, please
read the migration guide to see if you may need to adapt your application while
upgrading.

### Where do I get it from?

The artifacts have been published to Maven Central as usual, but this time for two different Scala versions:

`"com.typesafe.akka" % "akka-actor_2.10" % "2.2.0"` using Scala 2.10.2

`"com.typesafe.akka" % "akka-actor_2.11.0-M3" % "2.2.0"` using Scala 2.11.0-M3
