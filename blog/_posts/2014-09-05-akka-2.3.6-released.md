*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.6. This is the sixth maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. This release contains the following improvements:

 - [A fix](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15671) for a wrong snapshot file being offered to a recovering persistent actor was contributed by [blawlor](https://github.com/blawlor).
 - [A fix](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15730) for a PersistentView which was not working with `context.become`.
 - [An addition](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15544) to the ever-growing [akka-bench-jmh](https://github.com/akka/akka/tree/master/akka-bench-jmh/src/main/scala/akka) micro-benchmarks. This time a benchmark for `AtLeastOneDelivery` trait was contributed by [hepin1989](https://github.com/hepin1989).

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.6 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.6+is%3Aclosed).

Akka 2.3.6 is released for Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.2. This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.3.5 which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.
