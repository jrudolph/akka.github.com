We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of
**Akka 2.1.0 ‘Mingus’**. We are proud to include the work of 17 external
committers, plus the work done by our great community in reporting and helping
to diagnose bugs along the way.

This release refines and builds upon version 2.0, which was published a bit
over nine months ago. The most prominent new features are

* cluster support (experimental, including cluster membership logic & death watch and cluster-aware routers, see more below)
* integration with Scala standard library (SIP-14 Futures, dataflow as add-on module, akka-actor.jar will be part of the Scala distribution)
* Akka Camel support (Raymond Roestenburg & Piotr Gabryanczyk)
* Encrypted Akka Remoting using SSL/TLS (Peter Badenhorst)
* OSGi meta-information for most bundles (excluding samples and tests, Gert Vanthienen)
* an ActorDSL for more concise actor declarations, e.g. in the REPL
* a module for multi-node testing (to support you in developing clustered applications, experimental in the same sense as cluster support)
* a Java API for the TestKit

In addition there have been a great number of small fixes and improvements,
documentation updates (including a whole new section on message delivery
guarantees), an area for contributions—akka-contrib—where community
developments can mature and prove themselves and many more. A series of blog
posts high-lighting the new features has been published over the past weeks on
our team blog, see [the “spotlight21” tag](http://letitcrash.com/tagged/spotlight21).

## About the Cluster Support

The “akka-cluster” module is published under the name
“akka-cluster-experimental” to emphasize that its status is not yet final. This
denomination is not due to sub-par standard of the module; the cluster support
has been tested thoroughly and it works as documented. The reason for the
“experimental” tag is that this rather important module is now presented to the
general public for the first time, and although we have received valuable
feedback from early adopters we anticipate possible API changes in order to
meet all of your requirements. Work is continuing on Akka’s cluster support,
and we will formally declare it officially supported and stable with the next
major release—*Akka 2.2 ‘Coltrane’*. Please help us make it the best possible
solution by continuing to give feedback on the mailing list and telling us what
can be improved.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

The artifacts comprising this release candidate have been published to
`https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/` and also to Maven
Central. In addition, we adopted the SBT standard of encoding the Scala binary
version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is
`akka-actor_2.10`.

## Additional Information

Akka is released under the Apache V2 license.
