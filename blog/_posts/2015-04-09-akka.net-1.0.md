Today we are thrilled by the
[announcement of Akka.NET 1.0](http://petabridge.com/blog/akkadotnet-v1-live-reactive-model-comes-to-clr/),
a port of Akka from the JVM to Microsoft’s Common Language Runtime (CLR). The
team and community around Roger Alsing and Aaron Stannard valiantly took it
upon themselves to supply the growing open-source movement in the .NET world
with a full-fledged reactive toolkit, making the benefits of [reactive
application design](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) available to C# and F#
developers.

For more information see also the [Typesafe blog](http://typesafe.com/blog/akkanet-the-reactive-story-continues-on-the-microsoft-clr)
and the [Akka.NET release notes](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/releases/tag/v1.0).
