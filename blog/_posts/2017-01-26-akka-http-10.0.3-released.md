Dear hakkers,

we ‚Äî the Akka HTTP committers ‚Äî are happy to announce the availability of the third maintenance release of Akka HTTP 10.0.
This release also includes the security fix that was released earlier this week as Akka HTTP 10.0.2.

The most notable changes in this release are:

 * The addition of the experimental HttpApp feature to write simple Akka HTTP server with as little boilerplate as possible.
   Thanks a lot, [@jlprat](https://github.com/jlprat) for contributing this feature and carrying through the PR with the
   most comments so far!
 * Several bug fixes.
 * Lots of smaller and larger documentation fixes contributed by the community.
 * We also made a lot of progress on the upcoming experimental Http/2 support for Akka HTTP. The bold ones of you can
   already get the artifact (`akka-http2-support`) as a preview and start playing around. We will continue to complete
   functionality and polish the rough edges. Stay tuned!

## Changed semantics

In some cases, we need to change semantics slightly to fix bugs. Some user code may still rely on the
previous behavior so we are listing them here to bring attention to potential issues.

 * `Uri.Authority.toString` now doesn't render leading double slashes any more ([#784](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/784))
 * request URIs for requests coming in for a server set up to use TLS now carry the `https` scheme ([#658](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/658))

## Binary Compatibility

Akka 10.0.x is backwards binary [compatible](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5-M1/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html)
with previous 10.0.x releases and Akka 2.4.x. This means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for
the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction).
It should be noted that Scala 2.12.x is is not binary compatible with Scala 2.11.x.

Akka-Http will be binary and source compatible with the upcoming Akka 2.5 release for which the [first
milestone was released](http://akka.io/news/2017/01/26/akka-2.5-M1-released.html) this morning.
