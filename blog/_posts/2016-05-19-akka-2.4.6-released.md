*Dear hakkers,*

soon after [releasing Akka 2.4.5](http://akka.io/news/2016/05/17/akka-2.4.5-released.html) with the new Routing DSL
for Java it was discovered (thanks [relgames](https://github.com/relgames)) that the `akka-http-experimental` artifact
was incomplete ([#20556](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20556)), and the missing class files did in fact make
parts of the high-level server APIs unusable.

We are therefore with some urgency releasing a new minor update, Akka 2.4.6, to correct this.

The small list of changes since 2.4.5 is available under the
[2.4.6](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.4.6+is%3Aclosed) milestone on github for your reference.


Happy hakking!
