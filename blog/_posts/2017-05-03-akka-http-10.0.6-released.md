Dear hakkers,

we — the Akka HTTP committers — are happy to announce Akka Http 10.0.6, which is the sixth release of the Akka Http 10.0 series.
It contains an important security fix for a vulnerability that affects all Akka HTTP applications that use the
Akka HTTP routing DSL. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to crash an Akka HTTP server with a simple request leading
to a denial of service. It is highly recommended to update to Akka HTTP 10.0.6 as soon as possible.
See the [security announcement](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/10.0.6/security/2017-05-03-illegal-media-range-in-accept-header-causes-stackoverflowerror.html)
for more details.

Please subscribe to the [akka-security](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-security) mailing list to be notified
promptly about future security issues.

This update also contains several maintenance fixes and improvements as detailed below.

### Compatibility notes

This version is compatible with Akka 2.4.x as well as the current 2.5.1, so we encourage you to use Akka 2.5 with this
version, as the new completely redesigned materializer in Akka Streams can result in various performance and memory usage
improvements across the board.

If you want to use Akka HTTP together with Akka 2.5.1 make sure to include a dependency to akka-stream 2.5.1 and not only
to akka-actor 2.5.1 (otherwise, your app may fail at runtime because of incompatibilities between a 2.4.x version of
akka-stream and a 2.5.x version of akka-actor).

Akka 10.0.x is backwards binary compatible with previous 10.0.x releases and Akka 2.4.x. This means that the new JARs
are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the
inliner (Scala-only restriction). It should be noted that Scala 2.12.x is is not binary compatible with Scala 2.11.x.
