*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.4.1. 

This release contains a few important fixes and improvements:

* Shard region now kills shards more consistently on HandOff
* An empty shard region now shuts down correctly on graceful shutdown
* Using the distributed data mode the sharding coordinator updates correctly after leader downing
* Possibility to provide a custom supervision strategy for the BackOffSupervisor
* Problem with split brain on cluster startup under some circumstances solved
* A new `Supervisor` that supports exponential restart back-off semantics for actors regardless of their lifecycle model (the BackoffSupervisor overloads the meaning of self-termination)

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.4.1 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.4.1).

Akka 2.4.1 is released for Scala 2.11, 2.12.0-M3 and Java 8.

### Migrating from Older Relases ###

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.3.x please have a look at the [migration guide](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.1/project/migration-guide-2.3.x-2.4.x.html).

### Additional Release Details ###

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the sbt standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.11”.
