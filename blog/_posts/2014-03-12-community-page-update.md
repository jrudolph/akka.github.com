short: Initiating community driven collection of Akka-related projects
---

There is a great wealth of projects out there using Akka or offering
improvements and additional features, but up to this point we have only
manually tried to present a selection on our community page. This effort is
obviously doomed, we cannot keep up with all the development that is happening,
which is why we now take the step to reinvision the community page.

## By the Community, For the Community

The idea is that you collect projects that you find useful, or that you created
for the greater good, or that you happened to initiate for learning purposes
and which grew beyond that. The information that is in the resulting list
should give potential users an idea of how active the project is, for which
Akka versions it is available and so on.

## Including Spray

While Spray is being integrated as the new Akka HTTP module there are also
additions and extensions to this great library. In addition to tracking them on
[spray.io](http://spray.io/) we also included a section on the Akka community
page to express that out HTTP module will be the logical successor to Spray,
and we hope that much of the Spray communityâ€™s work will follow the transition
as well.

## Go Forth and Edit

So without further ado, here is the link to the new [community page](/community).
