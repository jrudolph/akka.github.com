Dear hakkers,

This is to announce the immediate availability of a security patch release, addressing a potential denial of service 
attack targeting Akka HTTP in versions listed below. The vulnerability was brought to our attention by Dmitry Kolesnikov 
and Lari Hotari whom we'd like to thank for their thorough investigation and following our [security process](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/10.0.2/security.html#reporting-vulnerabilities).
                                                                                                       
## Description of Vulnerability
 
For requests containing request bodies (including request methods which would normally *not* include entities like GET requests), 
a mistake in completion handling of a connection could lead to memory leaking after the connection had been closed before 
the entity was consumed. This may eventually lead to a failure of the system due to being out of memory.

## Affected Versions

- (experimental) Akka HTTP `2.4.11` and prior,
- (stable) Akka HTTP `10.0.1` and prior.

## Fixed Versions

We have prepared patches for the affected versions, and have released the following versions which resolve the issue: 

- Akka HTTP `2.4.11.1` (Scala 2.11)
- Akka HTTP `10.0.2` (Scala 2.11, 2.12)

The patched releases contain no other changes except the single patch that addresses the memory leak vulnerability. 
*Binary and source compatibility has been maintained so the upgrade procedure is as simple as changing the library dependency.*

## Additional Important Information

The full list of addressed issues is available in the [10.0.2 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/20?closed=1).

Note that Play and Lagom applications are not impacted by this vulnerability, regardless of whether they are using the Akka HTTP backend or the Netty backend.

Further details are explained in the Akka documentation's [security announcements section](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/10.0.2/security/2017-01-23-denial-of-service-via-leak-on-unconsumed-closed-connections.html).
