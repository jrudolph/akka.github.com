*Dear hakkers,*

we—the Akka committers—are proud to announce a new minor release of Akka, 2.4.5 that contains some pretty major news for those of you who are using Akka HTTP with Java.

**Rise of the “New” Java Routing DSL**

This release contains the long-awaited “new”
[Routing DSL for Java](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.5/java/http/routing-dsl/index.html),
which is an initiative started a few months ago by Jan Ypma ([jypma](https://github.com/jypma)) in which the Java
and Scala DSLs were to be made more similar to each other. This has a number of benefits: simplifying the learning
curve of either APIs, actually achieving feature parity between the APIs, and also a more Java8 feel thanks to
the intense use of lambda expressions. Also, numerous issues were found and fixed during the transition – be sure to
upgrade if you found problems in the old DSL.

Today, we announce that the API has been completed, and except minor changes we do not expect to do any large
refactorings like this one – we’re on our road to a stable Routing API. This sadly means that the changes are
rather wide-spread, and migrating from old to new may feel like learning an entire new API (which it is). If you run
into trouble migrating contact us via the mailing list or gitter chat; customers may of course ask for help via the
Lightbend support portal.

You will notice that [directives documentation](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.5/java/http/routing-dsl/directives/alphabetically.html)
is complete, however lacking code examples in some cases. We would like to ask for your help in finishing
the docs by adding code examples – these efforts can be coordinated as part of the [#20466](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20466) ticket.

**Other important fixes and improvements:**

* The cluster client and the cluster client receptionist now allow for subscribers to which the changes to
the current set of contacts or clients will be announced. ([#20446](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20446))
* FileIO streams factory methods using java.nio.Path added and the old File ([#20390](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20390))
* A bug in the Akka scheduler making it stop running scheduled events in a long lived actor system
([#20424](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20424)), thanks to [ecartner](https://github.com/ecartner) for finding and reproducing this issue
* Registration of custom MediaTypes for Akka HTTP ([#20397](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20397))
* Scala Routing DSL's (experimental) `Rest` path matcher was changed to be `Remaining` to be more consistent with other parts of the routing DSL

The full list of changes since the last milestone is available under the
[2.4.5](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.4.5) milestone on github for your reference.

**Credits**

Thanks to the Community! For this release we had the help of 48 committers. 
Special thanks to Jan Ypma for his involvement in the development of the new Java routing DSL.
