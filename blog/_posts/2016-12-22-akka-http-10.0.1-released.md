Dear hakkers,

We are proud to announce Akka Http 10.0.1, which is the first maintenance release of the Akka Http 10.0 series, and also
our small holiday present to you.

Some notable improvements and bug fixes are:

 * Lots of documentation improvements thanks to our awesome contributors.
 * Improved (debug) log messages for the infamous "No elements passed in the last 1 minute." timeout exception and
   `OutputTruncationException`. Both exceptions will now include more information about the context and the actual
   reason for the failure in the context of HTTP. More improvements will be made here in the future.

We still have lots of exciting pull requests open that didn't make the cut this time. In the coming month we
will continue to merge your contributions and will also continue the work on HTTP/2.

## Credits
A total 17 issues were closed since 10.0.1.
The complete list of closed issues can be found on the [10.0.1](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/17?closed=1) milestone on github.

For this release we had the help of 21 committers – thank you all very much!
