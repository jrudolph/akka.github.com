*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.16.
This is the 16th maintenance release of the 2.3 branch.
This release contains three bugfixes:

- Wraparound issue with the scheduler causing it to stop function correctly [20424](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20424)
- Issue in ConsistentHashingRouter causing problems for DNS resolution in Akka [20263](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20263)
- Backport of a serialization issue around `scala.Option` in Akka Persistence [16659](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/16659)

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.16 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.16+is%3Aclosed).

Akka 2.3.16 is released for Scala 2.10 and 2.11. This release is backwards binary compatible with all previous 2.3.x versions which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction).
Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.

### Additional Release Details ###

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the sbt standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10” or “akka-actor_2.11”, respectively.
