*Dear Hakkers,*

we—the Akka committers—are happy to announce the second maintenance release of [Akka Streams & HTTP 2.0](http://akka.io/news/2015/12/21/akka-streams-2.0-released.html). 
This minor update addresses a number of stability issues discovered recently, mostly in the HTTP and WebSocket code.

Meanwhile, we have moved all new Streams & HTTP development to the master branch, which means that these, as previously announced, 
will very soon become part of Akka 2.4, refer to the 2.0 release announcement if you are curious for details.

The most notable fixes in this release include:

- Http client causes 'Cannot pull port twice' error [#19094](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/19094)
- Empty.head in Websockets [#19417](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/19417)
- scalac bug when using members of MediaTypes in a map [#19418](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/19418)

The reference documentation for the 2.0.2 release can be found here for [Java](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/2.0.2/java.html) and [Scala](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/2.0.2/scala.html).

If you are upgrading from the old 1.0.x series, you may want to read the following 
[migration guide for Java](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/2.0.2/java/migration-guide-1.0-2.x-java.html) 
or [migration guide for Scala](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/2.0.2/scala/migration-guide-1.0-2.x-scala.html).

The full list of changes since the last milestone is available under the [stream-http-2.0.2](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Astream-http-2.0.2+is%3Aclosed) milestone on github for your reference.
