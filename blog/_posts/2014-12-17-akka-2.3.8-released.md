*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.8. This is the eighth maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. This release contains a few improvements and one new feature:

 - fix a bug in Clustering that could lead to Terminated being fired for remote actors without removing that remote node from the cluster
 - improve validation of actor names to work even for extremely long ones (several kilobytes)
 - fix a wrong link in the Remoting documentation, thanks hepin1989!
 - allow suppression of dead letter warnings for certain message types (mostly internal feature, see [here](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/16434/files#diff-4a800b1fb4a1e8e48263b5c52bf82f10R479) for details)

Akka 2.3.8 is released for Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.4. This release is backwards binary compatible with all previous 2.3.x versions which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.

### Migrating from Older Relases ###

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.2.x please have a look at the [migration guide](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.8/project/migration-guide-2.2.x-2.3.x.html).

### Additional Release Details ###

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the sbt standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10” or “akka-actor_2.11”, respectively.

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.8 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.8+is%3Aclosed).
