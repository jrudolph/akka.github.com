Dear hakkers,

We are proud to announce the release of Akka 2.4.12, which includes various small improvements and fixes across the board, as well as new security related features.

Most notably these are:

* Improvements of SSL handling in the remoting layer of Akka
* Support for log [Markers](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21671) by Akka Logging as well as akka-slf4j, which can be used to mark specific log entries as Security related etc.
* Some internal log statements in Akka now mark logs as security related with the SECURITY marker.

Akka HTTP is *not* part of this release as it [has moved to it’s own repository](http://github.com/akka/akka-http) and will be released very soon under it’s own version number.

Please read the discussions and announcements about the [split of Akka HTTP into it’s own versioning scheme on akka meta](https://github.com/akka/akka-meta/issues/27). At the same time we’ll announce all remaining modules of Akka HTTP as stable and begin a more definite sunsetting of Spray. More details on that in the upcoming release announcement - watch this space.
