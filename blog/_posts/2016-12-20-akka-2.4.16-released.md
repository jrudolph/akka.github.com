Dear hakkers,

We are proud to announce Akka 2.4.16, which is another maintenance release of Akka 2.4. 

Some notable improvements and bug fixes are:

* [durable storage](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.16/scala/distributed-data.html#Durable_Storage) of Distributed Data, [#21645](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21645)
* API for ActorSystemSettings, [#21894](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21894)
* optimize monitoring SPI for Artery, [#21924](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/21924)
* fix regression that caused sharding entities to not always be restarted when coordinator is moved to another node, [#21892](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21892)
* treat NotSerializableException from deserialization as transient problem in remoting, [#20641](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20641)

The observant reader might notice that we skipped 2.4.15. It was dead on arrival because it was released from the wrong branch.

## Credits

A total 41 issues were closed since 2.4.14.

The complete list of closed issues can be found on the [2.4.16](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/100?closed=1) milestones on github.

For this release we had the help of 15 committers – thank you all very much!
