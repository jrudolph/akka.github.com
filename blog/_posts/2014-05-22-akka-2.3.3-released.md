*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.3. This is the third maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. It contains fixes for several issues and performance improvements.

Akka 2.3.3 is released for Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.1. If you were using Akka 2.3.2 for Scala 2.11.0 you need to update immediately, because serialization was broken in Scala 2.11.0. Therefore Akka 2.3.3 for Scala 2.11.1 is not serialization backwards compatible with Akka 2.3.2 for Scala 2.11.0.

This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.
