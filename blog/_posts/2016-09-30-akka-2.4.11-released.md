Dear hakkers,

We are proud to announce the release of Akka 2.4.11, which includes the new experimental Akka Remoting, codenamed Artery.

Some noteworthy changes in the 2.4.11 release are:

* New remoting, see below
* Progress of Akka Typed, see below
* Fixed an issue where in some cases cancel or failure events was dropped in Streams leading to potential deadlock [#21446](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21446)

## New Remoting

Artery is a reimplementation of the old remoting module aimed at improving performance and stability. It is mostly source compatible with the old implementation and it is a drop-in replacement in many cases. Main features of Artery compared to the previous implementation:

* Based on [Aeron](https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron) (UDP) instead of TCP
* Focused on high-throughput, low-latency communication, mostly allocation-free operation
* Isolation of internal control messages from user messages improving stability and reducing false failure detection in case of heavy traffic by using a dedicated subchannel.
* Support for a separate subchannel for large messages to avoid interference with smaller messages
* Compression of actor paths on the wire to reduce overhead for smaller messages
* Support for faster serialization/deserialization using ByteBuffers directly
* Built-in Flight-Recorder to help debugging implementation issues without polluting users logs with implementation specific events
* Providing protocol stability across major Akka versions to support rolling updates of large-scale systems

The new remoting is enabled with configuration:

~~~
akka.remote.artery {
  enabled = on
  # The hostname or ip clients should connect to.
  canonical.hostname = localhost
  # use 0 if you want a random available port
  canonical.port = 25520
}
~~~

The protocol part of the actor system address is now simply akka, so you need to change previous akka.tcp to akka in for example configuration of cluster seed-nodes.

Please read the documentation for [Scala](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/remoting-artery.html) or [Java](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/java/remoting-artery.html) for more details.

The full list of changes since the last milestone is available under the [2.4.11-ARTERY](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/97?closed=1) milestone on github for your reference.

## Akka Typed

This release brings some significant changes to the Akka Typed module:

* a completely new [implementation](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/21128) that has 20–30% less message-passing overhead even though it has not yet been fully optimized—the goal is to allow zero-allocation messaging once we have all the pieces in place
* a few semantic simplifications, most of which have little to no impact on what can be expressed by user code but which tremendously simplify the internal implementation, see [the discussion on akka-meta](https://github.com/akka/akka-meta/issues/18), the summary of the [differences in the Actor lifecycle](https://github.com/akka/akka-meta/issues/21), and the [notes on co-existence of typed and untyped Actors](https://github.com/akka/akka-meta/issues/26)
* the [removal of Props](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21597) which now do not serve enough purpose anymore to warrant all those extra allocations

All these changes are contributed by [Actyx](https://actyx.io/), the company Roland Kuhn co-founded recently. Actyx is interested in pushing Akka Typed forward as an open-source base technology for the implementation of cloud services for the manufacturing industry.

## Credits

A total 46 issues were closed since 2.4.10 (New remoting not counted).

The complete list of closed issues can be found on the[ 2.4.11](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/96?closed=1) and [2.4.11-ARTERY](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/97?closed=1) milestones on github.

For this release we had the help of 19 committers – thank you!

A special thanks to [Łukasz Dubiel](https://github.com/bambuchaAdm) who contributed to Artery and [Roland Kuhn](https://github.com/rkuhn) who contributed to Akka Typed.
