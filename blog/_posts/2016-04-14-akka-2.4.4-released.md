*Dear hakkers,*

We have expedited the 2.4.4 release due to a few annoying bugs in 2.4.3.

Important fixes:

* Enable streaming responses with ‘Connection: close’, issue [#20254](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/20254)
* NPE in ConsistentHashingRouter for SimpleDnsManager, issue [#20263](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20263)
* Streams wiring should work in arbitrary nest levels far from original module, issue [#20216](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20216)
* Fixed dangerous sharing of state in HTTP’s connection management (thanks Samuel Tardieu and Mark van der Tol!), issues [#20228](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20228) [#20080](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20080)
* Fix and enable Server Name Indication configuration via ssl-config, issue [#20214](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20214)

Several other things were also improved, see the [2.4.4](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.4.4) milestone on github
