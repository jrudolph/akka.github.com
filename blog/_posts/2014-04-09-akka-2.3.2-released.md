*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.2. This is the second maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. It contains fixes for several issues.

This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.3.0 and 2.3.1 which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.

### Migrating from Older Relases ###

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.2.x please have a look at our [migration guide](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.2/project/migration-guide-2.2.x-2.3.x.html).

### 2.3.2 compared to 2.3.1: ###

* 5 tickets closed
