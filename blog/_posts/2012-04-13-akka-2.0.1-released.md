Five weeks after the release of the very well received version 2.0, we have
accumulated enough small fixes and enhancements to warrant a binary compatible
bugfix release.

We would like to thank our great community for not only reporting, but also
helping in fixing the issues which turned up: starting from very precise
diagnostic information, over fixing errors in the documentation to submitting
complete pull requests for performance enhancement. Special thanks go to
*Jean-Fran√ßois Im*, *Mathias Doenitz* and *Vibul Imtarnasan*!

The issues fixed are:

* improved **Java API** for accessing singletons like akka.routing.CurrentRoutees and friends (also our beloved PoisonPill)
* reject **invalid ActorSystem names** which lead to problems when going remote (essentially must be valid hostname components now)
* fixed a **live-lock in ForkJoinPool** which could occur under rare circumstances with parallelism levels 2 or 4
* **reduced overhead of ask()**: less memory footprint and lazy registration
* several improvements and fixes for **documentation** (ScalaDoc as well as reStructuredText)
* make cause and message of AskTimeoutException accessible
* make SmallestMailboxRouter config serializable (this might require recompilation of classes mixing in SmallestMailboxLike)
* fix **SmallestMailboxRouter crash** upon sending under pressure
* make RemoteLifeCycleEvents serializable
* fix TestActorRef for actors setting ReceiveTimeout in constructor
* fix **zeromq performance and instabilities** by running the polling loop only on the same thread as all other activities for the socket
* never restart zeromq socket actors in case of fatal socket errors
* opened up visibility of RemoteTransport.send() and notifyListeners() to improve extensibility
