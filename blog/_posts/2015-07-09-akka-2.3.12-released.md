*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.12. This is the twelfth maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. This release contains a few important fixes:

 - a fix for a race between Terminated message and final write in TCP ([#17932](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17932))
 - a fix for CircuitBreaker where concurrent transitions did not occur ([#17415](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17415))
 - improvement in flow control of system message delivery ([#17554](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17554))

This release also [adds a configurable TestActor creation timeout in TestKit](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17711), [suppresses Tcp.CloseCommand from logging](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17572) and improves documentation ([#17669](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17669), [#15569](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15569)).

Akka 2.3.12 is released for Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.5. This release is backwards binary compatible with all previous 2.3.x versions which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.

### Migrating from Older Relases ###

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.2.x please have a look at the [migration guide](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.11/project/migration-guide-2.2.x-2.3.x.html).

### Additional Release Details ###

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the sbt standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10” or “akka-actor_2.11”, respectively.

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.12 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.12).
